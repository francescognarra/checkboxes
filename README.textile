h2. Introduction

This gem will help you to handle _has_many :through_ associations when you need to add/remove these ones with checkboxes. If you think about this type of situation you do the same steps for each association you have to handle with checkboxes. I exctracted this gem from a project where I had to handle about ten associations with checkboxes.

h2. How to use it

The best way to describe throughcheckboxes is to show some code:

In your model:

<pre>
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :groups,:through=>:user_groups
    has_many :user_groups
    # add your associations
    checkboxes_for :groups
end

class Group < ActiveRecord::Base
    attr_accessible :name

    def to_s
        name
    end
end

class UserGroup < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :group
end
</pre>

In your view:

<pre>
<%= form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.error_messages %>
  <%= f.checkboxes_for :groups  %>
  </p>
  <p><%= f.submit %></p>
<% end %>
</pre>

and that's all. Now, when you submit your form you get the has_many :through association updated.
